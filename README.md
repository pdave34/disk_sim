# disk_sim

A simple N-body gravity solver to emulate Ostriker & Pebble's 1973 paper (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973ApJ...186..467O/abstract)

The demo notebook initializes 300 equal mass particles in a disk of radius R = 1. These initial paramters can be changed to explore the parameter space, similar to the paper. After adding dispersion and ensuring the disk retains it's initial kinetic energy, the notebook runs an example simulation for roughly one orbital period.
